name = input("Type your name ")
# input function will print this message and will store that input in name variable.

print("Hello " + name)

# input function will always take input as a string even if it is a number.

age = input("What is your age ? ")
print(name + age)

# As we know you can only add string with string not a number hence age is string not a number.
